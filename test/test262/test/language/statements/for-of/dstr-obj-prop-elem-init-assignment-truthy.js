    1. Let keyResult be the result of performing ? ForIn/OfHeadEvaluation(« »,
       AssignmentExpression, iterate).
    2. Return ? ForIn/OfBodyEvaluation(LeftHandSideExpression, Statement,
       keyResult, assignment, labelSet).

    4. If destructuring is true and if lhsKind is assignment, then
       a. Assert: lhs is a LeftHandSideExpression.
       b. Let assignmentPattern be the parse of the source text corresponding to
          lhs using AssignmentPattern as the goal symbol.
