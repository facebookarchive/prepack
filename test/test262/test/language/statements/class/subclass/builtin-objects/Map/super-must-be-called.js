  23.1.1 The Map Constructor

  ...

  The Map constructor is designed to be subclassable. It may be used as the
  value in an extends clause of a class definition. Subclass constructors that
  intend to inherit the specified Map behaviour must include a super call to the
  Map constructor to create and initialize the subclass instance with the
  internal state necessary to support the Map.prototype built-in methods.
