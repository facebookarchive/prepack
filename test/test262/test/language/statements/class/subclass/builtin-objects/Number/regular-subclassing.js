  20.1.1 The Number Constructor

  ...

  The Number constructor is designed to be subclassable. It may be used as the
  value of an extends clause of a class definition. Subclass constructors that
  intend to inherit the specified Number behaviour must include a super call to
  the Number constructor to create and initialize the subclass instance with a
  [[NumberData]] internal slot.
