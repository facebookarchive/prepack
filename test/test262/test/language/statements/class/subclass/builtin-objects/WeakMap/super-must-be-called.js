  23.3.1 The WeakMap Constructor

  ...

  The WeakMap constructor is designed to be subclassable. It may be used as the
  value in an extends clause of a class definition. Subclass constructors that
  intend to inherit the specified WeakMap behaviour must include a super call to
  the WeakMap constructor to create and initialize the subclass instance with
  the internal state necessary to support the WeakMap.prototype built-in
  methods.
