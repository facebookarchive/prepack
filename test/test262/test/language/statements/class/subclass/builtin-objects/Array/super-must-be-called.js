  22.1.1 The Array Constructor

  ...

  The Array constructor is designed to be subclassable. It may be used as the
  value of an extends clause of a class definition. Subclass constructors that
  intend to inherit the exotic Array behaviour must include a super call to the
  Array constructor to initialize subclass instances that are exotic Array
  objects.
