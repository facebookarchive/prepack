description: Subclassed Function instances has length and name properties
info: >
  19.2.4.2 name

  The value of the name property is an String that is descriptive of the
  function. The name has no semantic significance but is typically a variable or
  property name that is used to refer to the function at its point of definition
  in ECMAScript code. This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: false,
  [[Enumerable]]: false, [[Configurable]]: true }.

  Anonymous functions objects that do not have a contextual name associated with
  them by this specification do not have a name own property but inherit the
  name property of %FunctionPrototype%.
