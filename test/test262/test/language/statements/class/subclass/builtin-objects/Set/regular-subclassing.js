  23.2.1 The Set Constructor

  ...

  The Set constructor is designed to be subclassable. It may be used as the
  value in an extends clause of a class definition. Subclass constructors that
  intend to inherit the specified Set behaviour must include a super call to the
  Set constructor to create and initialize the subclass instance with the
  internal state necessary to support the Set.prototype built-in methods.
