  25.4.3 The Promise Constructor

  ...

  The Promise constructor is designed to be subclassable. It may be used as the
  value in an extends clause of a class definition. Subclass constructors that
  intend to inherit the specified Promise behaviour must include a super call
  to the Promise constructor to create and initialize the subclass instance with
  the internal state necessary to support the Promise and Promise.prototype
  built-in methods.
