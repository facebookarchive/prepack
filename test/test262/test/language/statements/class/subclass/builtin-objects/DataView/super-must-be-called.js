  24.2.2 The DataView Constructor

  ...

  The DataView constructor is designed to be subclassable. It may be used as the
  value of an extends clause of a class definition. Subclass constructors that
  intend to inherit the specified DataView behaviour must include a super call
  to the DataView constructor to create and initialize subclass instances with
  the internal state necessary to support the DataView.prototype built-in
  methods.
