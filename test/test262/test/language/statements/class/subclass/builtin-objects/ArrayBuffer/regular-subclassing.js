  24.1.2 The ArrayBuffer Constructor

  ...

  The ArrayBuffer constructor is designed to be subclassable. It may be used as
  the value of an extends clause of a class definition. Subclass constructors
  that intend to inherit the specified ArrayBuffer behaviour must include a
  super call to the ArrayBuffer constructor to create and initialize subclass
  instances with the internal state necessary to support the
  ArrayBuffer.prototype built-in methods.

var ab = new AB(4);

var sliced = ab.slice(0, 1);

assert(sliced instanceof AB);
assert(sliced instanceof ArrayBuffer);
