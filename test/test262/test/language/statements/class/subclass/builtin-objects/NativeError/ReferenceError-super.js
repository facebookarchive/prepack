  19.5.6.1  NativeError Constructors

  ...
  Each NativeError constructor is designed to be subclassable. It may be used as
  the value of an extends clause of a class definition. Subclass constructors
  that intend to inherit the specified NativeError behaviour must include a
  super call to the NativeError constructor to create and initialize subclass
  instances with a [[ErrorData]] internal slot.
