  21.2.3 The RegExp Constructor

  ...

  The RegExp constructor is designed to be subclassable. It may be used as the
  value of an extends clause of a class definition. Subclass constructors that
  intend to inherit the specified RegExp behaviour must include a super call to
  the RegExp constructor to create and initialize subclass instances with the
  necessary internal slots.
