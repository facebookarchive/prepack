  19.5.1 The Error Constructor

  ...
  The Error constructor is designed to be subclassable. It may be used as the
  alue of an extends clause of a class definition. Subclass constructors that
  intend to inherit the specified Error behaviour must include a super call to
  the Error constructor to create and initialize subclass instances with a
  [[ErrorData]] internal slot.
