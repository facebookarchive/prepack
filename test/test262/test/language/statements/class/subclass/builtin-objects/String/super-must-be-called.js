  21.1.1 The String Constructor

  ...
  The String constructor is designed to be subclassable. It may be used as the
  value of an extends clause of a class definition. Subclass constructors that
  intend to inherit the specified String behaviour must include a super call to
  the String constructor to create and initialize the subclass instance with a
  [[StringData]] internal slot.
