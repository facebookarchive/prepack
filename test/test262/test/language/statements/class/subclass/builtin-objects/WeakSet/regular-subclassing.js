  23.4.1 The WeakSet Constructor

  ...

  The WeakSet constructor is designed to be subclassable. It may be used as the
  value in an extends clause of a class definition. Subclass constructors that
  intend to inherit the specified WeakSet behaviour must include a super call to
  the WeakSet constructor to create and initialize the subclass instance with
  the internal state necessary to support the WeakSet.prototype built-in
  methods.
