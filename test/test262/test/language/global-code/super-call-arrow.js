description: An ArrowFunction in global code may not contain SuperCall
info: |
  - It is a Syntax Error if StatementList Contains super unless the source code
    containing super is eval code that is being processed by a direct eval that
    is contained in function code that is not the function code of an
    ArrowFunction.

  14.2.3 Static Semantics: Contains

  With parameter symbol.

  ArrowFunction : ArrowParameters => ConciseBody

  1. If symbol is not one of NewTarget, SuperProperty, SuperCall, super or
     this, return false.
  2. If ArrowParameters Contains symbol is true, return true.
  3. Return ConciseBody Contains symbol.

  NOTE Normally, Contains does not look inside most function forms. However,
       Contains is used to detect new.target, this, and super usage within an
       ArrowFunction.
