    Since LineTerminator(LT) between Postfix Increment/Decrement
    Operator(I/DO) and operand is not allowed, two IO(just as two DO
    and their combination) between two references separated by [LT]
    after automatic semicolon insertion lead to syntax error
    ES6 specifies this as `ReferenceError`
