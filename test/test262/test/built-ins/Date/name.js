  17 ECMAScript Standard Built-in Objects:

  Every built-in Function object, including constructors, that is not
  identified as an anonymous function has a name property whose value is a
  String.

  if it exists, has the attributes { [[Writable]]: false, [[Enumerable]]:
  false, [[Configurable]]: true }.
