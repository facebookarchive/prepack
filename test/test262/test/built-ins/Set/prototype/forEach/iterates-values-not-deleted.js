      a. If e is not empty, then

    NOTE:

    callbackfn should be a function that accepts three arguments. forEach calls callbackfn once for each value present in the set object, in value insertion order. callbackfn is called only for values of the Set which actually exist; it is not called for keys that have been deleted from the set.
