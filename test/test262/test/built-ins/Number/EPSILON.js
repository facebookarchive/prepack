  20.1.2.1 Number.EPSILON

  The value of Number.EPSILON is the difference between 1 and the smallest value
  greater than 1 that is representable as a Number value, which is approximately
  2.2204460492503130808472633361816 x 10-16.

  This property has the attributes { [[Writable]]: false, [[Enumerable]]: false,
  [[Configurable]]: false }.
