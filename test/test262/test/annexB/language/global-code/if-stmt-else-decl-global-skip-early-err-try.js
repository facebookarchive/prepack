description: Extension is observed when creation of variable binding would not produce an early error (try statement) (IfStatement with a declaration in the second statement position in the global scope)
esid: sec-functiondeclarations-in-ifstatement-statement-clauses
es6id: B.3.4
flags: [generated, noStrict]
info: |
    The following rules for IfStatement augment those in 13.6:

    IfStatement[Yield, Return]:
        if ( Expression[In, ?Yield] ) FunctionDeclaration[?Yield] else Statement[?Yield, ?Return]
        if ( Expression[In, ?Yield] ) Statement[?Yield, ?Return] else FunctionDeclaration[?Yield]
        if ( Expression[In, ?Yield] ) FunctionDeclaration[?Yield] else FunctionDeclaration[?Yield]
        if ( Expression[In, ?Yield] ) FunctionDeclaration[?Yield]


    B.3.3.2 Changes to GlobalDeclarationInstantiation

    [...]
    b. If replacing the FunctionDeclaration f with a VariableStatement that has
       F as a BindingIdentifier would not produce any Early Errors for script,
       then
    [...]

    B.3.5 VariableStatements in Catch Blocks

    [...]
    - It is a Syntax Error if any element of the BoundNames of CatchParameter
      also occurs in the VarDeclaredNames of Block unless CatchParameter is
      CatchParameter:BindingIdentifier and that element is only bound by a
      VariableStatement, the VariableDeclarationList of a for statement, or the
      ForBinding of a for-in statement.
