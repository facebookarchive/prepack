    B.3.3.3 Changes to EvalDeclarationInstantiation

    [...]
    ii. If replacing the FunctionDeclaration f with a VariableStatement that
        has F as a BindingIdentifier would not produce any Early Errors for
        body, then
    [...]

    B.3.5 VariableStatements in Catch Blocks

    [...]
    - It is a Syntax Error if any element of the BoundNames of CatchParameter
      also occurs in the VarDeclaredNames of Block unless CatchParameter is
      CatchParameter:BindingIdentifier and that element is only bound by a
      VariableStatement, the VariableDeclarationList of a for statement, or the
      ForBinding of a for-in statement.
