    2. If instantiatedVarNames does not contain F, then
       a. Perform ! varEnvRec.CreateMutableBinding(F, false).
       b. Perform varEnvRec.InitializeBinding(F, undefined).
       c. Append F to instantiatedVarNames.

    B.3.5 VariableStatements in Catch Blocks

    [...]
    - It is a Syntax Error if any element of the BoundNames of CatchParameter
      also occurs in the VarDeclaredNames of Block unless CatchParameter is
      CatchParameter:BindingIdentifier and that element is only bound by a
      VariableStatement, the VariableDeclarationList of a for statement, or the
      ForBinding of a for-in statement.
